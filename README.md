# Caesar-Cipher
Method in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence
A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. 
A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on.
